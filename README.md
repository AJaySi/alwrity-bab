#### BAB Copywriting Formula

BAB stands for Before-After-Bridge. It's a copywriting formula that involves:

1. **Before**: Presenting the current undesirable situation or problem faced by the audience.
2. **After**: Describing the desired state or outcome the audience wants to achieve.
3. **Bridge**: Introducing your product or service as the solution that bridges the gap between the before and after states.

The BAB formula is effective in capturing attention, creating desire for change, and presenting your solution as the means to achieve it.

#### BAB Copywriting Formula: Simple Example

- **Before**: Are you tired of waking up tired every morning?
